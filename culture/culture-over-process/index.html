		<h2>Lessons from a Startup #2</h2>


<p>Lessons from a startup is a series of articles focussing around what I've learned by succeeding <em>and</em> failing over the past two years at multiple startups, including: SD Elements, The K Network, and Ting.</p>

<p>This article deals with defining the Startup's culture and using it to succesfuly adapt new processes.</p>

<h3><u>What's Culture</u></h3>


<p>This entire article is central to the word 'culture', and the need for an 'open culture' for healthy growth in an organization. So before we start talkin' jive, let's define culture.</p>

<p>I used Webster's dictionary which defines four components of culture: <strong>Attitudes, Values, Goals and Practices</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, the components of an open culture could be as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Attitudes</strong>: be open to ideas, we're more than just our defined roles</li>
<li><strong>Values</strong>: transparency, honest reflection</li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>: outstanding customer experience, great work environment</li>
<li><strong>Practices</strong>: be agile, challenge ideas, empower others</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture" target="_blank" class="highlight">Websters dictionary</a> also includes the caveat for <strong>dependency</strong> shaping culture, stating that "culture depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations."</p>

<p><img class="inline-shot" src="/assets/images/kotrt.png">
I want to stress that depedency on knowledge should <em><b>not</b></em> be dogmatic, as shared knowledge comes from non-identical environments, with different attitudes, values, goals, practices...and people.</p>

<p>So Recognize fact this by reflecting on the best practices of others from the context of <em>your</em> culture. For example:</p>

<p></p>
<span class="highlight-green">Process driven (bad)</span>: "I read that sprint meetings give visibility and offer a time for our team to reflect.  Let's have sprint meetings every week".</p>

<p><span class="highlight-green">Culture driven (better)</span>: "One of our goals is to have transparency in our workflow. A lot of teams have success with sprint meetings. The advantages &amp; disadvantages are '________'. How would they work for us?</p>

<p>The result of a culture driven approach is that you get to form and own processes borne from the needs of your organization and tailored by the people with whom you work. This requires a dependency on continuous discourse.</p>

<h3><u>Using Discourse</u></h3>




<p>
Being culture driven means creating continuous open discourse. What I mean by open is encouraging active communication with and between everyone: developers, qa, designers, directors, interns, with yourself, and anyone else that's affected by any new process you're introducing.
</p>


<p>As a designer, I want to have conversations with everyone that's impacted by what I work on, so that those conversations can shape what I do and how I do it. That way we can adapt the design workflow into a process that's transparent...always open to discourse. It's important to note I'm writing here about the process around design, as an example, not the decisions on a design.</p>

<p>The medium for this discourse is different for everyone: some communicate by e-mails, some in person, some during standups, etc. And some conversations are just suited for certain mediums over others. Though if this is the case, then it's really important to make sure that these individual conversations are someone visisble to others that missed them, so that everyone can be on the same page, or at least the same chapter...more or less. It might be a best effort endeavor.</p>

<p>I've found that as long as the conversations happen, everyone can work towards shaping how we do things, or at least feel empowered with the ability to do so. But with the possibility of change in the air, you'll find two personalities, those that resist, and those that are naive.</p>

<p><span class="highlight-green">Beware Resistance to Change, and Naivety:</span></p>

<p><span class="inline-shot"><img src="/assets/images/rif.png"></span></p>

<p>We still need to find ways to overcome resistance to the change in processes that allow for everything I've written about so-far to happen. Even from ourselves, as we are defined by our own history of attitudes, values, goals and practices that can naturally form outright resistance to foreign ideas. This can cripple healthy growth -- there's a difference between a critical approach and outright resistance.</p>

<p>There's also the opposite trap of being niavely accepting of changes, as we can be naive in easily accepting any process without a healthy discussion and investment from everyone involved. Attempting this blind integration of a process can result in simple unneeded change instead of real growth.</p>

<p>One approach I've found succesful to overcoming these challenges is fostering new processes in a grass-roots way, to the point where you don't have to foster it anymore, it just happens.</p>

<p><span class="highlight-green">The right stuff:</span></p>

<p>Healthy growth necessitates an openness to adopt 'the right drivers' for 'the right change' to be implemented in 'the right way'.</p>

<p><strong>The right drivers:</strong> come from identifying pain points people on your team feel.</p>

<p><strong>The right change:</strong> is brainstormed by your team, not just management. It's a conversation.</p>

<p><strong>The right implementation:</strong> is an agreed process -- or <span class="highlight-green">practice</span> -- framed around the adaptable <span class="highlight-green">principles, values and goals</span> of your culture that encourage healthy growth.</p>

<p>There's always a barrier to implementing the best case solution to whatever the problem your team finds itself facing. Borrowing from Lean Startup, a Minimum Viable Solution usually works.</p>

<p>For example, if our development team decides that fully specing tickets is the way to go, a good first step is breaking tickets down into smaller tasks, as other tickets. Since developers on the product team are used to creating tickets, it's a smaller barrier to entry than writing out a full spec in a larger ticket. Breaking tickets down into smaller tasks was very similar to specing out tickets, and was a baby step towards what we wanted. It turned out to be a nice way to explore implementing code for features faster, since closed tickets are merged code, and led the way for us to slowly adopt specing tickets without alienting ourselves from the idea altogether.</p>

<p>This was all a result of creating an open culture, and actually listening to ourselves through continuous discourse rather than just implementing a process that 'works'...or doing nothing.</p>

<p><span class="highlight-green">3 pre-requisites to listening to your organizations culture: </span></p>

<p>So to recap:</p>

<ol>
<li>Share your organization's reigns</li>
<li>Define a framework around the four components of your culture (attitudes, values, goals, practices)</li>
<li>Establish discourse &amp; synthesize what you learn from others around this framework</li>
</ol>


<p>How do you define your 4 components, and how is the discourse going? I'm curious to know.</p>

<p><strong>Good luck,</strong></p>
