Before we start talkin' jive, let's define culture.

<h3><u>What's Culture and how does it shape growth?</u></h3>

Webster defines 5 components of culture:

- **Attitudes**: be open to ideas, we're more than just our defined roles
- **Values**: transparency, honest reflection
- **Goals**: outstanding customer experience, great work environment
- **Practices**: be agile, ask questions, challenge ideas, empower others
- **Dependency**: culture depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations

I filled in the first four with what I think makes an open culture. The last one, dependency is as defined in the dictitionary.


Though, the dependency part is <em><b>not</b></em> dogmatic -- so make sure to synthesize.

Shared knowledge always comes from non-identical environments. Recognize this by putting the best practices of others in context using culture driven synthesis. For example:

>**Process driven (bad):** "I read that sprint meetings give visibility and offer a time for our team reflect.  Let's have sprint meetings every week".

>Vs.

>**Culture driven (good):** "One of our goals is to have transparency in our workflow. A lot of teams have success with sprint meetings. The advantages & disadvantages are '________'. How would they work in our organization?

Being culture driven means creating continuous open discourse. Open means having conversations with and between everyone: developers, qa, designers, directors, interns, with yourself, and anyone else that's affected by any new process you're introducing. Looking inward forms a strong culture that results implementing something that works, even if you have to do it incrementaly.

<span class="highlight-green">Beware resistance and naivety:</span>

The examples I gave above tried to convey two things:

1. We need to find ways to overcome resistance. We are defined by our own history of attitudes, values, goals and practices that can naturally form outright resistance to foreign ideas. This can cripple healthy growth. We need to find ways to overcome

1. Letting go of ownership will overcome naivety. We can be naive in easily accepting any process that worked elsewhere without a healthy discussion and buy-in from everyone you're involving. Attempting this can result in simple unneeded change instead of real growth.

<br />
<span class="highlight-green">The right stuff:</span>

This means that healthy growth necessitates an openness to adopt 'the right drivers' for 'the right change' to be implemented in 'the right way'.

>**The right drivers:** come from identifying paint points, like team confusion about business requirements: "why are we building a notification system?".

>**The right change:** is a conversation: User stories can work, or better descriptions of tasks/tickets, early involvement of dev team in design. 

>**The right implementation:** is an agreement framed around the adaptable principles, values and goals of your culture that encourage growth.

<br />
<span class="highlight-green">This entire shindig has 3 pre-requisites: </span>

1. Share the reigns
1. Define your four components (attitudes, values, goals, practices)
1. Establish discourse

How do you define your 4 components, and how is the discourse going? I'm curious to know.

**Good luck,**
