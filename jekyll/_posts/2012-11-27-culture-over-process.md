<u>What's Culture and how does it shape growth?</u>
=
<br />
<span class="highlight-green">5 components of open culture:</span>

- **Attitudes**: be open to ideas, we're more than just our defined roles
- **Values**: transparency, honest reflection
- **Goals**: outstanding customer experience, great work environment
- **Practices**: be agile, ask questions, challenge ideas, empower others
- **Dependency**: culture depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations

<br />
<span class="highlight-green">But this dependency is not Dogmatic: </span>

Shared knowledge comes from non-identical environments. Recognize this by putting the best practices of others in context:

><s>**Process:** "I read that sprint meetings give visibility and offer a time for our team reflect.  Let's have sprint meetings every week".</s> 

>Vs.

>**Culture:** "One of our goals is to have transparency in our workflow. A lot of teams have success with sprint meetings. The advantages & disadvantages are '________'. How would this work in our organization?

Have this conversation with and between developers, qa, designers, directors, interns, with yourself, and anyone else that's effected by this new process. A strong culture results in these proposals and conversations coming from the ground up, not just from 'management'.

<br />
<span class="highlight-green">Resistance and naivety:</span>

The examples I gave above tried to convey two things:

1. We are defined by our own history of attitudes, values, goals and practices that can naturally form outright resistance to foreign ideas. This can cripple healthy growth.

1. We can also be naive in easily accepting any process that worked elsewhere without a healthy discussion and buy-in from everyone you're involving. This can replace growth with just unneeded change.

<br />
<span class="highlight-green">Conclusion?</span>

So that means that healthy growth necessitates an openness to adopt 'the right drivers' for 'the right change' to be implemented in 'the right way'.

>**The right drivers:** come from identifying paint points, like team confusion about business requirements: "why are we building a notification system?".

>**The right change:** is a conversation: User stories can work, or better descriptions of tasks/tickets, early involvement of dev team in design. 

>**The right implementation:** is an agreement framed around the adaptable principles, values and goals that encourage growth:

5 components of open culture:

- **Attitudes**: be open to ideas, we're more than just our defined roles
- **Values**: transparency, honest reflection
- **Goals**: outstanding customer experience, great work environment
- **Practices**: be agile, ask questions, challenge ideas, empower others
- **Dependency**: culture depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations

So agree on these components first, and you'll have a framework to discuss solutions. They're not written in stone either, but they'll give you a really good starting point. See what works, then iterate.

**Good luck,**
