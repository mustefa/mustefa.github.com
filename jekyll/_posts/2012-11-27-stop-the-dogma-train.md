Since the early part of 2011, I spent a lot of time reading about Agile, culture, and best practices -- integrating what I learned with varying degrees of success into how I work.

Aside from the many magical 
<a class="highlight" href="http://www.allaboutunicorns.com/images/logo.jpg">Agile, UX, or Lean</a>
lessons, the most valuable take-away was learning how to apply the stuff espoused by Spolsky, Gothelf, Ries, or David -- or Dick, Sam or Harry -- into our organization in a healthy way.

>**<span class="highlight-green">...the thing that makes <s>*what*</s> these guys say interesting things is <u>*why</u>* the say them; <u>why</u> they were driven to reach their conclusions.</span>**

<br />
In short, don't fall into the trap of adopting processes without focussing on encouraging a culture that seeks growth based on it's context:
<br />
><s>**Imposing Process:** "I read lots of good stuff about Agile & Lean UX. Let's do it."</s>

>Vs.

>**Process resulting from a healthy culture:** "Let's reflect on the design process from the past sprint and weigh the pro's and con's of applying Agile & Lean principles."

<br />

<span class="highlight-green">So...</span>

The result of the latter over the former is that you maintain a focus on the things you need -- the things that serve you now.

It's like dev / feature creep: sure it'd be great to use backbone.js, or let our users do '_____', but are these things addressing your current pain points, or are they just nice to have?

<br />
**Good luck,**
