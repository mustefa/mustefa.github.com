<h2>Lessons from a Startup #1</h2>

Lessons from a startup is a series of articles focussing around what I've learned by succeeding <em>and</em> failing over the past two years at multiple startups, including: SD Elements, The K Network, and Ting. 

This article deals with integrating what we learn from from others with varying degrees of success into how we work.

<h3><u>Magic? What Magic?</u></h3>

Aside from the many magical 
<a class="highlight" href="http://www.allaboutunicorns.com/images/logo.jpg">Agile, UX, or Lean</a>
lessons, the most valuable thing I've learned is how to apply what's espoused by Spolsky, Gothelf, Ries, or David -- and many others -- in a healthy way.

>**<span class="highlight-green">...the important thing is not *what* they say, but rather <u>*why*</u> they are driven to reach their conclusions.</span>**

They create best practices based on their respective contexts. And for the most part, they encourage others to do the same. A lot of times when I attend Lean Startup events and talk to people that apply Lean methodologies, I hear: "Agile/Lean says you have to do it like *this*, so let's do the same thing." And that's what I mean by drinking the Kool-Aid. 

Speaking from my experience @sdelements and now at @tucows, and from talking to other Entrepreanuers that actually *get it*, it's important that people introduced to these methodologies recognize the difference between using them as a framework versus using them to imposing processes.

I feel like standing on top of a table and yelling *"synthesize what you learn from others and reflect it in your own context; apply these best practices as they fit for you right now!"*

I attended a <a class="highlight" href="http://marscommons.marsdd.com/startupsblog/lean-startup-conference-video-stream/">Lean Startup Conference</a> in Toronto at <a class="highlight" href="http://marscommons.marsdd.com" target="_blank">MaRS commons</a> this week, and took some notes from speakers on the panel that were reverberating the need for synthesis over dogma. Here are a couple key quotes:

>'What does success look like at this stage, this iteration? Keep the next stage in perspective and don't lose focus'.<br /> 
><a class="highlight" href="http://zakhomuth.com" target="_blank">**Zak Homuth, Upverter**</a>

>'Don't look for a silver bullet. All of the recipes are there, but you need to apply the principles you learn about contextually to your environment.'<br />
><a class="highlight" href="http://jetcooper.com" target="_blank">**Satish Kanwar, Jet Cooper**</a>

From many speakers on the panel, this message was the common thread. Watch the video for the conference linked in blue above. <a class="highlight" href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/12/sketchnotes-lean-startup-day/" target="_blank"> Also check out Sacha Chua's Sketchnotes from the event.</a>

Many of the attendees of these events are individuals taking a leap into their first startup, or people from organizations that haven't been exposed to strong agile or lean methodologies before. And for these individuals, it can be easy to fall into the trap of applying what they hear and read into what they do as dogma. <span class="highlight-green">It's important that every message of 'this is how I did it' should be accompanied by 'this is why I did it.'</span>

Anything more I say on this will be repitition, so on a last note I'll liken this entire post to an analogy from product development:

Sure it'd be great to use a framework like backbone.js, or let our users sign-in with Facebook, Twitter, Google AND OpenID. But are these things really addressing our current pain points, or are they just nice to have? Or are we doing it because we want to be cool too. Don't be the latter.

Have you succeeded / failed in trying to carbon-copy a process? Did you variate or alter processes learned from others? I'd like to hear from you. So would the rest of the world.

**Good luck,**
