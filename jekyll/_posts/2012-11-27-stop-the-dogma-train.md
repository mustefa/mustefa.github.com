Since the early part of 2011, I spent a lot of time reading about Agile, culture, and best practices -- integrating what I learned with varying degrees of success into how I work.

Aside from the many magical 
<a class="highlight" href="http://www.allaboutunicorns.com/images/logo.jpg">Agile, UX, or Lean</a>
lessons, the most valuable take-away was learning how to apply the stuff espoused by Spolsky, Gothelf, Ries, or David -- or Dick, Sam or Harry -- into our organization in a healthy way.

>**<span class="highlight-green">...the thing that makes these guys interesting is <u>*why</u>* they hold their views, not what they say. <u>Why</u> they are driven to reach their conclusions.</span>**

<br />

<p>

They create best practices based on their respective contexts, and they encourage a similar culture of reactionary growth...for the most part. Still, a lot of times you read and hear "this is how you should do it because it's how it worked for me". 
</p>
<p>
I try not to impose processes like this, but instead synthesize from others and reflect on my own context, applying best practices as they fit. 
</p>

<br />
For example:

**Imposing Process (bad):** "I read lots of good stuff about Agile & Lean UX. Let's do it."</s>

>Vs.

**Process resulting from a healthy synthesis (better):** "Let's reflect on the past sprint and weigh the pro's and con's of applying Agile & Lean principles to our process."
<br />
<p>
The result of the latter over the former is that I maintain a focus on the things I need -- the things that serve me now.
</p>
It's like dev / feature creep: sure it'd be great to use backbone.js, or let our users do '_____', but are these things addressing our current pain points, or are they just nice to have?
<p>
Have you succeeded / failed in trying to carbon-copy a process? Did you succeed by variating? I'd like to hear from you.
</p>
**Good luck,**
