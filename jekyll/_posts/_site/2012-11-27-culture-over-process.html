<h3><u>What's Culture</u></h3>
<p>This entire article is central to the word &#8216;culture&#8217;, and the need for an &#8216;open culture&#8217; for healthy growth in an organization. So before we start talkin&#8217; jive, let&#8217;s define culture.</p>

<p>I used Webster&#8217;s dictionary which defines four components of culture: <strong>Attitudes, Values, Goals and Practices</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, the components of an open culture could be as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Attitudes</strong>: be open to ideas, we&#8217;re more than just our defined roles</li>

<li><strong>Values</strong>: transparency, honest reflection</li>

<li><strong>Goals</strong>: outstanding customer experience, great work environment</li>

<li><strong>Practices</strong>: be agile, challenge ideas, empower others</li>
</ol>

<p>Websters dictionary also includes the caveat for <strong>dependency</strong> shaping culture, stating that &#8220;culture depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations.&#8221;</p>
<a class='highlight' href='http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture' target='_blank'>- Source -</a><img class='inline-shot' src='/images/kotrt.png' />
<p>I want to stress that depedency on knowledge should <em><b>not</b></em> be dogmatic, as shared knowledge comes from non-identical environments.</p>

<p>Recognize this by reflecting on the best practices of others from <em>your</em> context.</p>

<p>For example: &lt;/p&gt; Process driven (bad): &#8220;I read that sprint meetings give visibility and offer a time for our team to reflect. Let&#8217;s have sprint meetings every week&#8221;.</p>

<p>Culture driven (better): &#8220;One of our goals is to have transparency in our workflow. A lot of teams have success with sprint meetings. The advantages &amp; disadvantages are &#8216;________&#8217;. How would they work in our organization?</p>
<br /><h3><u>How Does Culture Shape Growth?</u></h3><p>
So being culture driven means creating continuous open discourse. What I mean by open is encouraging active communication with and between everyone: developers, qa, designers, directors, interns, with yourself, and anyone else that's affected by any new process you're introducing.
</p>
<p>As a designer, I want to have conversations with everyone that&#8217;s impacted by what I work on, so that those conversations can shape what I do and how I do it. That way we can adapt the design workflow into a process that&#8217;s transparent&#8230;always open to discourse. It&#8217;s important to note I&#8217;m writing here about the process around design, as an example, not the decisions on a design.</p>

<p>The medium for this discourse is different for everyone: some communicate by e-mails, some in person, some during standups, etc. And some conversations are just suited for certain mediums over others. Though if this is the case, then it&#8217;s really important to make sure that these individual conversations are someone visisble to others that missed them, so that everyone can be on the same page, or at least the same chapter&#8230;more or less. It might be a best effort endeavor.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found that as long as the conversations happen, everyone can work towards shaping how we do things, or at least feel empowered with the ability to do so.</p>
<span class='highlight-green'>Beware Resistance to Change, and Naivety:</span><span class='inline-shot'><img src='/images/rif.png' /></span>
<p>We still need to find ways to overcome resistance to the change in processes that allow for everything I&#8217;ve written about so-far to happen. Even from ourselves, as we are defined by our own history of attitudes, values, goals and practices that can naturally form outright resistance to foreign ideas. This can cripple healthy growth &#8211; there&#8217;s a difference between a critical approach and outright resistance.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the opposite trap of being niavely accepting of changes, as we can be naive in easily accepting any process without a healthy discussion and investment from everyone involved. Attempting this blind integration of a process can result in simple unneeded change instead of real growth.</p>
<span class='highlight-green'>The right stuff:</span>
<p>Healthy growth necessitates an openness to adopt &#8216;the right drivers&#8217; for &#8216;the right change&#8217; to be implemented in &#8216;the right way&#8217;.</p>

<p><strong>The right drivers:</strong> come from identifying paint points, like team confusion about business requirements: &#8220;why are we building a notification system?&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>The right change:</strong> is a conversation &#8211; user stories might not work, maybe we need better descriptions of tasks/tickets, or earlier involvement of the dev team in design.</p>

<p><strong>The right implementation:</strong> is an agreed process &#8211; or <span class='highlight-green'>practice</span> &#8211; framed around the adaptable <span class='highlight-green'>principles, values and goals</span> of your culture that encourage healthy growth.</p>
<span class='highlight-green'>3 pre-requisites to listening to your organizations culture: </span>
<ol>
<li>Share the reigns</li>

<li>Define a framework around your four components (attitudes, values, goals, practices)</li>

<li>Establish discourse &amp; synthesize what you learn from others around this framework</li>
</ol>

<p>How do you define your 4 components, and how is the discourse going? I&#8217;m curious to know.</p>

<p><strong>Good luck,</strong></p>
