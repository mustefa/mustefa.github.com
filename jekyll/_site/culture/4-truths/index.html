		<h2>Lessons from a Startup #3</h2>


<p>Lessons from a startup is a series of articles focusing around what I've learned by succeeding <em>and</em> failing over the past two years at multiple startups, including: SD Elements, The K Network, and Ting.</p>

<p>This article looks back at 4 simple truths I'd learned from integrating UX into the daily workflow of an Agile Startup.</p>

<h3><u>4 Simple Truths</u></h3>


<p><strong>Truth #1: There will always emerge a hierarchy of roles, if not structure</strong></p>

<p><a class="inline-shot" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/kotrt.png"></a></p>

<p>No matter how open or flat an organization or teams structure is, it will typically at some point form a hierarchy. An organization can never be a communist state (or one can also argue that it could become just that in it's failed attempt at a flat hierarchy).</p>

<p>However teams are formed within organizations, they will establish a hierarchy of roles that's necessitated by the need for decisive forward motion in the various domains within the team, so that things don't stall.</p>

<p>For example, at <a class="highlight" href="http://www.sdelements.com">SD Elements</a> we had a flat hierarchy of people that specialized in various parts of the development process: front-end, back-end, API, content, UX (that's me!), deployment, etc.</p>

<p>Discussion throughout the team across all these domains was open. I provided an open channel of involvement amongst the entire team for UX Design, though I always needed to make decisive choices.  And for each respective domain people took a similar lead as a result of their skill set, or because they were simply hired to do the said jobs.</p>

<p><span class="highlight-green">Why is it important to identify this hierarchy of Roles?</span></p>

<p>Because when people are invested and have ownership over what they work on, they develop strong feelings about the processes they form to do their work. These processes also leak out across domains in the organization.</p>

<p>People on your team develop a vision (whether or not they're self-aware of this) for the type of environment within which they want to work, and within which they'd like to see others fit. These beliefs in certain processes develop  and become more apparent as team members solve problems together, when they find inefficiencies in the work-flow, and when they identify great efficiencies which they feel that they'd like to adopt as 'best practices' <em>across their organization</em>.</p>

<p>And eventually, as legend has it, these individuals will on-board others into their organizations and teams that they feel match this vision for the work environment they've helped build. You will often hear that companies hire people for personality &amp; fit, who are also able to get the job done...</p>

<p><span class="highlight-green">But then a strange thing happens:</span></p>

<p>People will grow &amp; gain new perspectives on life and work. They mature and start to question why they do what they do. And this is all out of the hands of the people that brought them on. It's out of their own hands too. Asking why and not settling for answers that they don't themselves discover is a natural human trait.</p>

<p>This growth can be better defined as a change in an individuals <em>attitude</em>, <em>goals</em>, <em>vision</em>and <em>practices</em>.  Their <em>culture</em> changes. And as these employees grow, a ripple effect is at least noticed by the rest of the team, and maybe even the whole organization:</p>

<p>As an example, when I joined Security Compass / SD Elements, I was a tools developer. I changed roles a few times, looking for my best fit at the company. I worked briefly as a Junior Security Consultant, and then again as an application developer before I transitioned into my role working on the usability for our application. I rapidly and rather naturally evolved this from simple usability reviews to Interface Designs, and discovered the world of Information Architecture &amp; Interaction Design. From my personal growth, I expanded my process to include all the due diligence required for great User Experience.</p>

<p>Working in an already highly Agile team had us naturally using UX tactics that others called 'Agile &amp; Lean UX'. We didn't look back as we continued to integrate these Agile and Lean UX practices into our work-flow and iterating. Things like cutting down on deliverables, involving the development team early on in the UX design process, eliminating buy-in in favour sharing the design marker itself, etc.</p>

<p>I remember discussing the plan for taking on usability at the time with Rohit Sethi, the VP of SD Elements, and how it would integrate within the product development team. I remember him saying 'If you're going to do this, I really want you to fully dive into UX'. Though I think that neither of us specifically foresaw the coming tide of integrating all of the things I'd mentioned in the previous paragraph, and how it would ripple throughout how we did things across the board.</p>

<p>As a result of my initial growth, as well as the similar growth of others within their roles, we created a ripple effect, questioning, challenging and hacking new methodologies across the domains of of Product Development -- feature development, customer support, and marketing and design.</p>

<p>The key thing to note here is that our organization's culture comprised of attitudes, values, goals and practices that <s>welcomed</s> expected to be challenged, proven right / wrong, and iterated.</p>

<p><span class="highlight-green">Which brings us back to thinking of an organization's culture:</span></p>

<p>The original plan for who you wanted on your team and how you imagined the environment to be can suddenly one day not be what you'd initially envisioned. 'Cause, ya'know, people change.</p>

<p>Yes I switched to the first person, and yes I'm talking to <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="http://2254a9d02b08b47afd5d-5a659056359faa679ad29652935f7074.r92.cf1.rackcdn.com/2010/07/Uncle-Sam-460x345.jpg"><em>you</em></a> ;)</p>

<p><strong>Truth #2: Resistance to cultural change is futile</strong></p>

<p><img class="inline-shot" src="/assets/images/rif.png"></p>

<p>What if these changes aren't necessarily negative and detrimental to the overall health of your environment? What if they just simply don't match the grand original vision you had in mind?</p>

<p>Well, you can resist the ripple of change, though resistance is futile.  If you decide this change is not what you want, you can fire and try and assimilate new hires, taking their strengths and bringing them into the collective... and they may very well repeat the cycle and either assimilate or leave, until you're only surrounded by Borg, or sheep, or even Tribbles or what have you.</p>

<p><a class="inline-shot-left" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribble" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tribbles.png"></a></p>

<p>You can alternatively embark on a social and professional experiment within your team to see where your team <em>leads you</em> and your organization. Everybody within the organization has an inherent responsibility to counter the inertia of lethargism.</p>

<p>Once a new person joins your group, they're immediately initiating a change in your dynamic, and the trajectory of your culture's space time continuum.</p>

<p><strong>Truth #3: You must align your group to a single vision so that everyone is a champion towards it's goals</strong></p>

<p>To achieve this not-so-simple step, continued alignment of your vision towards a single, or set of goals should be delegated to all members of your group to the point where you may, <strong>gasp</strong>, have a self-regulating organization.</p>

<p>How you reach your goals, or, the process that's created along the way to achieve your goal is then directly shaped by the self-regulated culture of your team without your imposed hierarchal interference.</p>

<p><span class="highlight-green">Self-regulation can mean a lot of things:</span></p>

<p>It can mean creating, testing and iterating processes together, holding yourselves accountable to these processes rather than to a declaration of arbitrarily set of rules, and calling out when these 'best practices' (or 'just practices') don't apply to your group. Self-regulation is always on the look out to keep iterating and improving the dynamic and efficiency of your team and whatever you do. It's a <em>framework</em> based on your culture that allows you to shapes and re-shape <em>processes</em>, rather than vice-versa.</p>

<p><strong>Truth #4: You'll lose control!</strong></p>

<p>I'm watching the extended commentary on the making of The Lord of the Rings, and just heard Peter Jackson reflecting on the fact that they were re-writing the script for LOTR throughout filming, multiple times a week, likening it to:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="highlight-green">laying the tracks in front of the train the whole time and the thing's coming down behind you.."</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Such a good analogy for those those who would seem to think that they will "lose control".</p>

<p>This isn't suggesting that you let the actual goals and principles that you want to adhere to change.  Or that your morals, principles and values get cast aside within your work environment.</p>

<p>Rather, what I've learned from these truths is that instead of trying to build a team and organization that adheres to specific processes, I encourage that we build a framework around constantly <em>redefined</em> and adaptable principles, values and goals within which change is open and encouraged.  See what works, then iterate.</p>

<p>Just do it. Let me know how it's going.</p>

<p><strong>Good luck,</strong></p>
